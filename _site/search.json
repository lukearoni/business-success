    "text": "Establishment entry rates vary amongst different metropolitan areas within the United States. I obtained a dataset containing business dynamics data from the US Census Bureau, including the 2022 establishment entry and exit rates for each metropolitan area. This records the number of new shops, startups, or franchise buildings divided by the total number of establishments in that area during 2022. I sought to use this data to find the metropolitan areas with the highest rate. Sheridan, Wyoming is a high outlier for establishment entry rates, with an over 6% increase from the second highest, while the rest of the top 20 metropolitan area entry rates don‚Äôt differ by more than 2.2%."

Some common factors that influence establishment entry rates in an area are their population growth and rate of increased building permits in recent years. The plots show that Sheridan was not within the top 10 for either metric. However, Sheridan was well above the median rate for both population growth and building permit rate of increase. This indicates that Sheridan‚Äôs high establishment entry rate was likely due to a multitude of factors, which can be further explored."

It is specified as a simple linear regression where the exit rate for observation ùëñ is modeled as a function of a constant intercept term \\(\\beta_0\\), the establishment entry rate multiplied by its slope coefficient \\(\\beta_1\\), and a random error term \\(\\epsilon_i\\), capturing unexplained variation. This model quantifies how changes in the rate at which new establishments enter the market are associated with changes in the rate at which existing establishment leave the market.\nThe second and third models similarly use a linear regression framework to relate the net job creation rate and job creation rate from births to the establishment entry rate. Here, for both, the dependent variable is the job creation rate attributed specifically to new business births, modeled as a linear function of the establishment entry rate, an intercept, and a random error term. All models assume linearity and normally distributed residuals, providing a basis to estimate and test the statistical significance of the association between business entry dynamics and employment growth."

Using data from the US Census Bureau, I aim to explore the effect of establishment entry rates to establishment exit rates and job growths in different areas of the US in 2022. There is a moderately strong linear correlation between establishment entry rate and exit rate, meaning that a higher entry rate will correlate with a higher exit rate. Thus, despite having a high establishment entry rate that would indicate economic growth, establishments would also increasingly leave that economy. One way to explain this is older shops closing down, and new shops taking their place."
